# testdrive

   Purpose:	TestDrive is a plugin that replaces the main feature of 
  		TestFlight - installing an iOS app over-the-air on an iOS 
  		device through a simple click on a link.
   Usage:	Version 1.0 of TestDrive does two things:
  		 1. It allows an iOS app developer to upload an .ipa and a 
  		    .plink file to the WordPress Media Library from their PC.
  		 2. It allows an iOS app tester to select a .plink file from the
  		    WordPress Media Library and to obtain an itms-services link,
  		    which they can touch to install the iOS app on their iOS 
  		    device.
  		Subsequent versions will have a much more TestFlight-like look
  		and feel. It will support an easy automated workflow for
  		non-technical testers to install and test your iOS app.
   Installation: 1. Create a self-signed certificate as per:
  		    https://blog.httpwatch.com/2013/12/12/five-tips-for-using-self-signed-ssl-certificates-with-ios/
  		 2. Make the .cer certificate file be available on a separate
  		    non-https website and open that website from your iOS device
  		    to install the certificate, or email it to your iOS device.
  		    NOTE: Don't simply open the https website from your iOS
  			  device without first installing the website
  			  certificate on that device - the browser on your iOS
  			  device will simply ignore the certificate on your
  			  https website, but it will *not* warn you that doing
  			  this will cause the iOS device to refuse to install 
  			  your iOS app later in the process.
  		 3. Setup SSL on your Apache server as per:
  		    https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html
  		 4. Install WordPress on your Apache server as per:
  		    https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install
  		 5. Open the command line and go to the plugins directory:
  		    $> cd /var/www/my-website/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
  		 6. Clone the testdrive plugin using git:
  		    $> git clone https://github.com/denal05/testdrive
  		 7. Open the browser on your PC, login to your WordPress
  		    website and go to Plugins:
  		    https://my-website.com/wp-admin/plugins.php
  		 8. Activate the TestDrive plugin.
  		 9. Compile your iOS app and create and ad-hoc archive as per:
  		    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19081180/ad-hoc-deployment
  		    NOTE: Be sure to follow all of their recommendations!
  		    NOTE: Troubleshoot as per:
  			  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20276907/enterprise-app-deployment-doesnt-work-on-ios-7-1
  		10. Edit your .plist file as per:
  		    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26306876/xcode6-how-to-export-an-app-with-plist-for-enterprise-distribution
  		    NOTE: If your .ipa file has a space in the filename, be 
  			  careful because WordPress will display the .ipa file
  			  just as you named it, but it will save it with a
  			  hyphen replacing the space in the filename, thus
  			  you should add the correct hyperlink to your .ipa
  			  file in your .plink file. Otherwise, upon trying to 
  			  install the iOS app to your iOS device you will get
  			  the error: "Unable to install MyApp!"
  		11. Open the command line and include the MIME types for .ipa and
  		    .plink in the following file:
  		    /var/www/my-website/wordpress/wp-includes/functions.php
  		    NOTE: If you don't, you won't be able to upload the .ipa &
  			  .plist files to WordPress!
  		12. Open the command line and change the following line in
  		    /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:
  			  upload_max_filesize = 64M
  		    NOTE: If you don't, you won't be able to upload the .ipa
  			  file, whose size is definitely greater than the 
  			  default upload max filesize of 2 MB!
  		    NOTE: I also modified the following files, but I'm unsure
  			  that it makes a difference:
  			  /var/www/testdrive/wordpress/wp-config.php
  			  /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf
  		    @TODO: Test whether the above two files make a difference!
  		13. Open the browser on your PC, login to your WordPress 
  		    website, and go to Media to upload your .ipa and .plist
  		    files:
  		    https://my-website.com/wp-admin/upload.php
  		14. Open the browser on your iOS device, login to your
  		    WordPress website and go to the TestDrive plugin page:
  		    https://my-website.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=td
  		15. Touch the "Select A .plist File" button, select one, and
  		    touch the "Insert" button.
  		16. Touch the "Download!" link - the iOS app should begin
  		    installing on your iOS device, please be patient.
   Support:	Currently we provide NO TECH SUPPORT FOR THIS PLUGIN - use at
